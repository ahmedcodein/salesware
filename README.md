# SalesWare

**SalesWar** is a sales process software tool. It aims to digitalize the sales activity in order to boost the productivity of your sales team.
The market entry of **SalesWare** is small businesses and startups. More specifically, those businesses that:
 - are neither content with using excel sheets to track their sales activity due to complexity and generality.
 - nor can offered the subscription fees of the established Software tools like Microsoft Dynamic or SalesForce.

**SalesWare** is built as a foundational module of a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. The envisioned CRM then represents the ultimate vision of this project. This vision includes other modules like MarketingWare, ServiceWare, SupportWare and DataWare. Moreover, each of those modules will integrate Data Analytics to bring additional value to our users.

**SalesWare** in its current state should not be viewed as a solution that promises all the expected features an established sales process tool or a CRM tool is assumed to have. But rather as a minimum viable product (MVP) with the main purpose of getting the Author at the door step of potential buyers. Through their feedbacks and unique sales process, **SalesWare** can be further developed to evolve into much more sophisticated sales tool.

## 1 Introduction

SalesWare is developed to help sales team to digitalize their sales process and track opportunities progress. In this introduction, the user will find all the required information to start working with the SalesWare.

In this section, we provide you with all the information required to use our solution, SalesWare. First we define the important terms and then provide a complete user manual which will help you start working with SalesWare.

### 1.1 Getting Started

Before embarking on how to use the tool, SalesWare user must be acquainted with few terms. These terms are organization, admin, user, prospect, product and opportunity.

#### Organization:
An organization is an owner of SalesWare license. This organization consists of multiple departments. The ultimate user of the SalesWare within this organization is the Sales Department team members.

#### Admin:
The admin is a member of the organization Sales department. The admin has unlimited user permissions over the SalesWare application. To add some colors, the admin is the Head of Sales Department, or any other title that is responsible for the sales team of that organization.

#### User:
A user is a member of the organization sales department with limited user permission. Most likely, the user is a sales manager, business developer etc.

#### Prospect:
A prospect is an external firm that is interested in one or more of the organization offerings.

#### Product:
A product is one of the organization offerings. It can be either a product or a service.

#### Opportunity:
An opportunity is a chance of selling the defined product to the defined prospect.

Since the main terms now are established, we can provide some detail about the software main components. In the current version, SalesWare comes with four main components. These are:

- **Prospect Management:**\
  The prospect management concerns with the listing/reading/creating/updating/deleting a prospect record.
- **Product Management;**\
  The prospect management concerns with the listing/reading/creating/updating/deleting a product record. 
- **Opportunity Management:**\
  The Opportunity Management concerns with the listing/reading/creating/updating/deleting an opportunity record.  
- **Communication Management:**\
  This Communication Management provides a communication means between SalesWare and its customer/users. 

  More information on each of the four component is provided in the next section. We will also explain how these terms and components are implemented and used to track your sales deals in addition to how to sign up, sing in and sign out of SalesWare.

### 1.2 SalesWare User Manual

The SalesWare User Manual is available on the following link: [User Manual](MANUAL.md)

## 2 Project Objective

This section is devoted to explain the rational behind developing SalesWare. It aims to answer the following questions:

Why SalesWare?
What drives the author to develop SalesWare?
Why the user should care about using SalesWare?

### 2.1 Project Objective

Sales activity is one of the main activities of any businesses. It produces important metrics of any organization. Senior-level executives use those metrics to analyze and evaluate the firm's health, competitions, product demands etc.. In addition, sales forecast drives most of the firm's future plans that touch upon every aspect of a business.

Having a sales software that collects, stores and present such data like, customers' data, firm's offerings, opportunities tracking, historical sales data, customer acquisition metrics and sales pipeline is , therefore, of a great help to the firm decision makers.

The Software As A Service (SAAS) has taped into this need. We witnessed in the last couple of decades an explode in the number of Sales tools and CRM systems. Yet, there is still a nontrivial number of organizations, small businesses and startups, use excel sheets or similar products to track and record their sales activity. This is due to the fact that the license cost of the sophisticated SAAS solutions are quite high making it a burden on those small businesses to acquire.

On the other hand, tools like excel sheets are not designed to serve sales people. They are built for general purposes, hence they are not easy to use. Furthermore, the customization of such tools comes with high cost. In addition, any change to the firm sales activity in terms of process, business rules or metrics will lead to massive adaptation cost.

All that led the author to consider developing a sales tool that can support those businesses by providing an affordable sales activity-tailored solution.
